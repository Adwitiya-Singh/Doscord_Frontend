kylechan19:so we saw the usernames
kylechan19: I left an output
jgarcia16432:alright what what can we talk about for like the next 5 minutes or 2 minutes
kylechan19:I mean really have outfit right now so we're good
nFactorial:them
jgarcia16432:a sentence
jgarcia16432: and the cows having the bot wasn't to our conversation right now
jgarcia16432: God give me a hand
kylechan19:it says message not defined
nFactorial:them
nFactorial:okay give me a chance to file yeah let's do this like that like make one and then let's
jgarcia16432:the weather will transfer back like an hour ago
nFactorial:stop wait I have the next leave it as that here it is so like here like Kyle said
nFactorial:this
nFactorial:so just so what does that keeps reading the file
nFactorial:I'm guessing weight
nFactorial:is it not on sorry
nFactorial:yeah no hear
nFactorial:so add a new line to it like so I'm guessing the Jets with just like coffee Basin you like do this and just like
nFactorial:go to the next line if you just change this output Leaf like I left output
nFactorial:then again like if you say
nFactorial:this
nFactorial:then again I got to know why does this not refresh have to change the time
nFactorial:but
nFactorial:it just keeps reading the file and like it's going to have to run its own process till like this just makes it its own process because it keeps running this thing doesn't know I don't think it's like that
nFactorial:yeah it doesn't like that
nFactorial:so yeah this is going to have to be its own process
nFactorial:dum dum of
nFactorial:so it keeps running it just keeps reading from the file and like it just whenever it season you like
nFactorial:lighted yielded
jgarcia16432:all right
nFactorial:now the question is how to reintegrate this
nFactorial:Lake will you have both the things running and then like
nFactorial:do you want to have this writing and the button ending on a computer like that's what will have to happen
jgarcia16432: that sounds like it
nFactorial:okay
jgarcia16432: Ayrsley I'm not a haircut now compared to State and it will run on my machine
kylechan19:it should
nFactorial:I mean I don't mind I don't mind like this you can land on yours
nFactorial:can you run the thing
jgarcia16432: how to take out the discard one running on my machine
jgarcia16432: my concern is on
nFactorial:wait all of it was after it on your machine so then you'll have to run this on your machine to but this is easy this is just one like a
nFactorial:pip install
jgarcia16432: I don't know I'm running aside for running Mac OS
jgarcia16432: Big Sur with an i7 that you can give the ram I think we can mostly defense
nFactorial:yeah I do know that all of this is like nothing here is heavy I think
nFactorial:is this reading of pilot writing on it
jgarcia16432: the most intense thing this PC has done was trying to identify Pokemon and that well that should take forever
nFactorial:better work
jgarcia16432:barely barely worked on the phone number of Pokemon go to buy extended 252 Pokemon has kept on this classifying them
jgarcia16432: it was not a fun experience I can tell you that assignment was a 3D to class
nFactorial:oh
nFactorial:who's 22 is that
jgarcia16432: I know I am I just approached it like yo I was like a doctor Sue and like Yoda algorithm learning project so what if I taught a program Pokemon so I did that with thank you for your notebook with some dude help me out till I get the whole thing up and running
nFactorial:tasted
jgarcia16432: yeah because he is into you like machine learning machine learning like data analytics like
jgarcia16432:so yeah I give it a python but I wasn't that good at it as it's kind of did redo programming from there
nFactorial:but this you just have to run this so like you have to let get on it
jgarcia16432: cocoppa
nFactorial:let's hope this should be good
jgarcia16432:so, do you want to terminate your boat's like a run the spot
kylechan19:yeah
jgarcia16432: all right
nFactorial:hey
jgarcia16432:is it ready
nFactorial:Bull Terrier
kylechan19:do you want me to take a screenshot of the terminal output with the code
jgarcia16432:yes
jgarcia16432:so I imagine some
jgarcia16432:play some transcribe outputs on text
jgarcia16432:I got to pick a cool coat snippet
jgarcia16432:Sports showing off
kylechan19:okay how's this book
jgarcia16432:code snippet
nFactorial:or showing off
jgarcia16432:I think it's the work song off
nFactorial:you guys decide I'm good either
jgarcia16432:all right if you want to go deeper in our code then I'll see if there's to get
nFactorial:code snippet
jgarcia16432:code snippet on kike a code snippet now
kylechan19:and then I'm working on fixing your
kylechan19:your thing
kylechan19:Prime 6
jgarcia16432:all right
kylechan19:and then I already have a test MP4 in there so let me see
kylechan19:if I do and sell
kylechan19:message attachment is not a Constructor
kylechan19:makes sense
jgarcia16432:weather in Port
jgarcia16432:something I probably did that to you
nFactorial:love don't ask about it can you read this and does this make sense
nFactorial:going to have to make like a whole different
nFactorial:whole different one talking about like how they read things because like
nFactorial:I have to write like how to bite on leg keeps eating from a new file in Lake do you think
nFactorial:ventilation you have talked about it how does it work
nFactorial:the at the beginning of the slides are General operation and as that the deeper we go we're trying to make it more
nFactorial:technical so whichever level of like understanding you want to
nFactorial:have other thing
nFactorial:the the general operation think yeah I sent like sentences on the
nFactorial:General chat with look better than they can do that
jgarcia16432:I need the diagram I just want to make sure we pick to go with the diagram okay
nFactorial:yeah yeah for sure so I'm going to go work on like Python and see if I can get it to
nFactorial:like a pedophile for Chris
jgarcia16432:this is your description required to have a cool sweetheart deal with it but yeah oh yeah
nFactorial:sure I will do that I will do that too
kylechan19:hey honey was there a plug-in for a message attachment
jgarcia16432:I need the end of the docks unfortunately
kylechan19:okay so so
nFactorial:Usher
nFactorial:so I fucked up my gate so that needs fixing
nFactorial:okay so now the python thing writes in a format that is compatible with Chris's thing so I think know all of our compatibility issues are done
jgarcia16432:cricket
nFactorial:do you want me to write the soap am I writing the logic of if someone writes exclamation ASL in the butt right
nFactorial:when someone says something after the write something after the asio command
nFactorial:like how does that look different
nFactorial:Gautam Singh
nFactorial:someone sent an ESL command to actually get that video for that exact line right like is that make sense
nFactorial:the python also needs to know someone said they are so, now I should save the video there
nFactorial:so
nFactorial:for that like purpose
nFactorial:I like when someone writes ASL command does it transcribe it in a different way does it like Canada write something before they are something like that
jgarcia16432:ignore what we can do
nFactorial:what's up
jgarcia16432:so hear me out
jgarcia16432:so right now it wasn't everything everything at the moment right
jgarcia16432:but if I could also be listening to the chat Q
jgarcia16432:spell we just right within the transcript mark down! ASL and then
jgarcia16432:does Rite Aid sell directly to the console
nFactorial:yeah just right there so you don't have great any logic like just straight the string ASL before it and then I'll handle it on the python side
nFactorial:okay okay
nFactorial:I wouldn't be able to have usernames right
nFactorial:so will it be a! ASL username colon and then message
nFactorial:let me save the username to like a because how we doing this are you guys taking care of the username how does that work actually
jgarcia16432:what is an automatic
nFactorial:like it oh it it like it
nFactorial:like you know whatever you were saying like who said it like whose words are you can scribing are you guys having that fart
jgarcia16432:as soon as Google cloud and Discord because it all separate audio streams that's going off
nFactorial:no no no no like you know how when you give me the transcript you give me someone's username colon and then what they said
nFactorial:so now when the butterfly is it has to like
nFactorial:Willard replies to it has to tell who's username like who said it right it has to say like in Factoria like my username like I am signing what n factorial said if that makes sense
kylechan19:right that's the message author we have that
nFactorial:over it says that
nFactorial:okay then then we're good then that works to then I just have to handle it like only save video when it has a hotel on it that's it I'm guessing
nFactorial:that that way does everyone agree with that before I have to admit it
kylechan19:oh wait nice okay I actually get what you're signing out we only say who issued the command
nFactorial:we only said who issued the command but after they should have came and they write a sentence after it right
nFactorial:or no
jgarcia16432:so we say it
jgarcia16432:issue are so
nFactorial:and then whatever said next is that what it is
jgarcia16432:ignored
kylechan19:got so we say who
nFactorial:ask for a fill
kylechan19:issued the command and then it'll look at the video and the send a video like no matter what that video is
nFactorial:oh so if if someone writes! ASL
nFactorial:then the next thing said should be transcribed is that what it is
nFactorial:okay just just just right in your transcription five and let's take a look let me take a look at what it looks like in the end and then I can like
nFactorial:with ASL command if you guys can like if we can get that working like we can show that off too if not we can just do the parts
nFactorial:works
nFactorial:are you doing
nFactorial:did I just feel bad my get is like fuck
nFactorial:how do I fix this
kylechan19:what happened
nFactorial:is this like I I start working on the base reader branch and then I was like I have to make up the iron jaundice to master but then there was like it was like 10 last night so like when we going to like to view it so I start working on this email so much heat is on this one branch
nFactorial:and I can make everything it's on gum it but then it still doesn't look great on Lake get
nFactorial:commit but yeah okay let's go
kylechan19:I'm still working on Branch 6 at the moment I should probably push all those comments I made so far and then my attempt to fix the attachment
nFactorial:I want help with like running the script how do you do that
kylechan19:would you ask
nFactorial:oh no Chris is so final think I'm guessing like two things in my liked asterisk right now one the Excel command once you're done with that I will like try and Implement that
nFactorial:the other thing is so now my python script needs to run Chris's like you know vascrypto save the video file so you're thinking find the video file
nFactorial:so trying to run bash script from python like
nFactorial:we can add Lake MI Bebe HP support to our thing to later
nFactorial:if a by those who consists of two lines
nFactorial:like if you run it was run but like in anything besides the control flow so like
!asl
nFactorial:you want that your coat it's just if you don't have a manual just bars the file is just enter printer
kylechan19:so we have exclamation is so running the file
kylechan19:and then I'm checking out the discard that dries dogs for sending attachments
nFactorial:I think it actually driving Chris f
nFactorial:like what have you created
nFactorial:I feel like it's working good
!asl
kylechan19:we did it
!asl
kylechan19:okay so now so it's so now we just have to you know update this video
nFactorial:what's up
nFactorial:oh what the fuck 9
nFactorial:send the fucking video fuck bro
nFactorial:I think it's at couch and who said it now who's with you transcribed can be given by like
kylechan19:but that has to be
kylechan19:yeah
nFactorial:I think it'll be on my side I will know who said it because I think yeah so do you want me to give you the name of the person can you put in the video again
nFactorial:that's like because this Discord won't know who said the next thing
kylechan19:we can
kylechan19:what is it
nFactorial:let me think about it
kylechan19:we can attach extra data to the video
kylechan19: do how do we know it's being sent back
nFactorial:yeah
nFactorial:yeah how about we name the video file like who said it but that janky solution but like
nFactorial:I don't know
nFactorial:something
kylechan19:okay the problem with that is I need a path to the video and the path includes the filename so
jgarcia16432:cheat code
jgarcia16432:so
nFactorial:yeah I don't know if it's like see your fingernails with where's the video file
jgarcia16432:so we we we we we we have the
jgarcia16432:a person's username right
jgarcia16432:hello
nFactorial:what's up
jgarcia16432:so we must let it go have the username correct
nFactorial:I have the person's username on the Fightin side yes
jgarcia16432:specify
jgarcia16432:what we get the directory I can only keep it the same as output but I need to call it video Dash name and that should not be a problem hopefully
nFactorial:wait what how do you give the lady who says the name to Discord Bots are like the video where they give me one second let me get this one with good so like copy paste this is it what you want
nFactorial:answer of this whole thing
nFactorial:I trust you
jgarcia16432:Rio Rico.
jgarcia16432:just like any old string in JavaScript to do dumb back to work and text and you get us up by tonight
nFactorial:is this the like
nFactorial:video
nFactorial:floating video camera
jgarcia16432:dollar sign
kylechan19:can't wait I have to have to make it so it doesn't send me a tab or try to send the attachment until there's been input
jgarcia16432:wake me to call the video theoretically anything
nFactorial:that's what I say
nFactorial:okay okay yeah okay so the script like looking I need if I'm Pagan like shit like that Christmas thing if you can include anything but looks like my thing save the file and can get the script to run so now let me look at the ASL singing that integrated and then like we have a monster
nFactorial:Okay so
nFactorial:build ideas why does it students
nFactorial:should ideas till translate only translate the line of Reyes all right
kylechan19:yeah
nFactorial:so it's going to be at South new line and then nothing after that
kylechan19:and then right now I'm making I'm making it so that it'll wait for a transcription
kylechan19: after ASL before I tried sending the attachment
nFactorial:I'll wait for the video to process and liability
kylechan19:right cuz if we if we decide ASL and no one said anything is going to break
nFactorial:oh there we also have to like make it like if it checks instantly for a video like this might take time to like find the video like make the video
jgarcia16432:we need cheap with you
nFactorial:yeah like just system. Sleep
jgarcia16432:I thought it was the exact way to do in jump bikes
nFactorial:set timer set timer
nFactorial:set a timer yeah dude running every like 10 seconds
jgarcia16432:does sex help you out a big Kyle I got you snip it right here
kylechan19:I should really push this hold on
jgarcia16432:I'm going to send you this school snippet
jgarcia16432:I forgot
jgarcia16432:what's the length is on that
nFactorial:wait I don't know how like
nFactorial:they come earlier with python and like nevermind my discourteous doesn't work
kylechan19:what what's a good prompt for the user to speak after they say exclamation ASL like please
nFactorial:I am listening to you what was the weird thing that it said last time
nFactorial:the scariest chicken register that
kylechan19:I don't know
nFactorial:Discord acting weird but yeah so
nFactorial:do you think this this is the
nFactorial:I'm going for can you like
kylechan19:yeah like there's going to be a slash in at the end
nFactorial:flash an idiot but stripper remove that
kylechan19:oh okay okay then that's it
nFactorial:yeah yeah okay
kylechan19:okay
jgarcia16432:Garcia timer code and practice but we got the demo
jgarcia16432:and I think it's the hundreds of a millisecond
kylechan19:if I do ASL
kylechan19:no it's okay that makes sense cuz that's there and not
kylechan19:hello
kylechan19:cancel that did not work
jgarcia16432:at the rate we're going so at 10 we still driver another presentation
nFactorial:yep
nFactorial:definitely
jgarcia16432:and if you guys it's me Haley does at stuff to do slides
jgarcia16432:and
jgarcia16432:School Educational
nFactorial:yeah
kylechan19:I'm fine with anything as long as it's not like totally Wild
andymerc:Anythink Queen on the Google games
